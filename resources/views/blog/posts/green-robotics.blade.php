        <h2>Technical Innovations</h2>
        <p>Let\'s look at some specific technical innovations in green robotics:</p>

        <h4>1. Smart Motion Planning</h4>
        <pre><code>
// Traditional approach:
function moveRobot(start, end) {
    return linearPath(start, end);
}

// Energy-efficient approach:
function moveRobot(start, end) {
    return optimizePathForEnergy(start, end, {
        considerInertia: true,
        useRegenerativeBraking: true,
        minimizeAcceleration: true
    });
}
        </code></pre>

        <h4>2. Adaptive Power Management</h4>
        <pre><code>
class GreenRobot {
    function adjustPower(task) {
        const requiredPower = calculateMinimumPower(task);
        const optimalSpeed = findEnergyEfficientSpeed(task);
        
        return {
            power: requiredPower,
            speed: optimalSpeed,
            mode: task.priority > HIGH ? "performance" : "eco"
        };
    }
}
        </code></pre>

        <h3>Environmental Impact Metrics</h3>
        <p>Modern green robotics systems include comprehensive environmental monitoring:</p>
        <ul>
